Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated to fulfil infinite wants of consumers.

**Logic of economics:**

- Earth has limited resources
- Resources are used to produce goods and services
- People have infinite wants and needs
- There is a conflict between finite resources and infinite needs and wants
- People can't have everything they want so resources must be rationed in some way
- This is where economics comes in
