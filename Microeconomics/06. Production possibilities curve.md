Also known as production possibility frontier

It is defined as the maximum combinations of goods and services that can be produced in a given period of time where all resources are used and technologies are fixed.

Since there are a lot of variables involved in creating goods and services, we fix some of them by making assumptions so that we can calculate the maximum combinations. These assumptions are:

1. Given time is fixed
2. All resources are allocated
3. Technology is fixed

Now suppose we have a country that has 20 people and everyone can make an iPhone or a Mountain bike in 1 day.

In an ideal scenario, if each person makes 1 iPhone in a day, it would look like this:

And is each person created 1 Mountain bike in 1 day, it would look like this:

![Pasted image 20231221172706.png | 500](./Assets/Pasted%20image%2020231221172706.png)

Joining the two points we get,

![Pasted image 20231221172749.png | 500](./Assets/Pasted%20image%2020231221172749.png)

But the world is not ideal, so is our 20 people country. There will be some people expert in making iPhones and some expert in making mountain bikes. If we allocated everyone to make one product, then the people who are not expert will not be able to create the product in one day, so total might be 15 or 16. The real curve would look somethings like this:

![Pasted image 20231221173027.png | 500](./Assets/Pasted%20image%2020231221173027.png)

The point where the real and ideal curve meets is the point where there is perfect allocation of resources, which impossible.

In an ideal world, we would be operating at point P, but that is not possible. In reality, we will be working at point A or near it. In order to get to point B, we will have to increase our production which shifts the PPC outwards, in order to do that we have to improve the factors of production.
